            <h2>Stone Giant</h2>
            <p>
                Coming to life as a chunk of stone, Tiny's origins are a mystery on which he continually speculates. He is a Stone Giant now, but what did he used to be? A splinter broken from a Golem's heel? A shard swept from a gargoyle-sculptor's workshop? A fragment of the Oracular Visage of Garthos? A deep curiosity drives him, and he travels the world tirelessly seeking his origins, his parentage, his people. As he roams, he gathers weight and size; the forces that weather lesser rocks, instead cause Tiny to grow and ever grow.

            <h2>Spectre</h2>
            <p>
                Just as higher states of energy seek a lower level, the Spectre known as Mercurial is a being of intense and violent energy who finds herself irresistibly drawn to scenes of strife as they unfold in the physical world. While her normal spectral state transcends sensory limitations, each time she takes on a physical manifestation, she is stricken by a loss of self--though not of purpose. In the clash of combat, her identity shatters and reconfigures, and she begins to regain awareness. She grasps that she is Mercurial the Spectre--and that all of her Haunts are but shadows of the one true Spectre. Focus comes in the struggle for survival; her true mind reasserts itself; until in the final moments of victory or defeat, she transcends matter and is restored once more to her eternal form.

                和所有强大的能量都喜欢欺凌弱小一样，被称为墨丘利的幽鬼也是一个拥有着强横能量的存在，同样的，她对现实世界中的冲突和纷争无比着迷。然而她平时的幽鬼形态超越了常人的感知范围，因此每当她以实体形态出现时，她不得不损失一部分自我能量——尽管她也不愿意。在战斗中，她的自我意识逐渐散落并重新聚合，她也开始有了意识。她意识到了自己是幽鬼墨丘利——其他所有的鬼影都只是她自我的阴影。出于重新凝聚的打算，她开始专注，她的心智也在不断的成熟。只有等到她取得胜利或者彻底失败时，她那超物质的形态才会得以重聚。

            <h2>Ancient Apparition</h2>
            <p>
                Kaldr, the Ancient Apparition, is an image projected from outside time. He springs from the cold, infinite void that both predates the universe and awaits its end. Kaldr is, Kaldr was, Kaldr shall be...and what we perceive, powerful as it appears to us, is but the faintest faded echo of the true, eternal Kaldr. Some believe that as the cosmos ages and approaches its final moments, the brightness and power of Kaldr will also intensify--that the Ancient Apparition will grow younger and stronger as eternity's end draws nigh. His grip of ice will bring all matter to a stop, his image will cast a light too terrible to behold. An Apparition no longer!

                卡德尔，极寒幽魂，是时光之外的冰冷投影。他来自寒冷的无尽虚空，目睹宇宙诞生，见证宇宙终结。卡德尔是夕在，今在，永在的无上力量...我们的所有认知，所有自认为正确的强大的事物，在永恒的卡德尔看来，不过是最细微最无力的附和。有人相信，随着宇宙的老化并走向衰亡，卡德尔的力量和光芒也将变得更强——极寒幽魂将更加年轻，更加强大。他对冰霜的控制能够冻结一切事物，他的投影放出的光芒异常夺目。他将不再是幽魂，而是神!

            <h2>Weaver</h2>
            <p>
                The fabric of creation needs constant care, lest it grow tattered; for when it unravels, whole worlds come undone. It is the work of the Weavers to keep the fabric tight, to repair worn spots in the mesh of reality. They also defend from the things that gnaw and lay their eggs in frayed regions, whose young can quickly devour an entire universe if the Weavers let their attention lapse. Skitskurr was a master Weaver, charged with keep one small patch of creation tightly woven and unfaded. But the job was not enough to satisfy. It nagged him that the original work of creation all lay in the past; the Loom had done its work and travelled on. He wanted to create rather than merely maintain--to weave worlds of his own devising. He began making small changes to his domain, but the thrill of creation proved addictive, and his strokes became bolder, pulling against the pattern that the Loom had woven. The guardians came, with their scissors, and Weaver's world was pared off, snipped from the cosmic tapestry, which they rewove without him in it. Skitskurr found himself alone, apart from his kind, a state that would have been torment for any other Weaver. But Skitskurr rejoiced, for now he was free. Free to create for himself, to begin anew. The raw materials he needed to weave a new reality were all around him. All he had to do was tear apart this old world at the seams.

                创世之纱需要长期细心的照料，以防止其变得残破；因为一旦它散开了，整个世界就将毁于一旦。编织者的工作就是保持创世之纱的紧密，用现实之网修补它的破损。他们同样要防止那些在创世之纱的缺口上产卵或者侵蚀创世之纱的虫子，只要编织者稍微分心，这些家伙的幼虫就能吞噬掉整个宇宙。斯吉茨格尔是一名大师级的编织者，负责维护一块小补丁的紧密。然而这项任务并不能满足他，他经常唠叨过去那些原始的创造工作，对干完活就走人的世界纺织者也是颇有微词。他想创造，不想只是维护——他想按自己的设计编织出自己的世界。他开始在他负责的区域上做手脚，逐渐不能自拔，他的胆子也愈发的大，甚至私自改动了世界纺织者编织的图案。最后，守卫者来了，毁掉了编织者所作的一切，直接从创世之纱上去除了这一块，然后重新编织，却不让他参与其中。斯吉茨格尔现在孤身一人，被种群所弃，换做任何其他编织者，都会备受折磨。然而斯吉茨格尔却无比愉悦，因为他终于自由了，能够自由的创造，重头开始。他创造新世界所需的所有材料都触手可及。他只需要从缺口处将现在的世界撕裂。

Once a feared leader in the army of the Purgers of the Realm, Doom left his position as a comrade of fellow demonic warriors as he simply could not bear the thought of sharing the glory of pillaging and feats of destruction with other lowly demons. Despite no longer leading an army, Doom is a fearful foe in combat, possessing mastery of hellish magic and physical attacks - eventually, the world will belong to Doom.

            <p>
                After years on the trail of a legendary Eldwurm, the Knight Davion found himself facing a disappointing foe: the dreaded Slyrak had grown ancient and frail, its wings tattered, its few remaining scales stricken with scale-rot, its fangs ground to nubs, and its fire-gouts no more threatening than a pack of wet matchsticks. Seeing no honor to be gained in dragon-murder, Knight Davion prepared to turn away and leave his old foe to die in peace. But a voice crept into his thoughts, and Slyrak gave a whispered plea that Davion might honor him with death in combat. Davion agreed, and found himself rewarded beyond expectation for his act of mercy: As he sank his blade in Slyrak's breast, the dragon pierced Davion's throat with a talon. As their blood mingled, Slyrak sent his power out along the Blood Route, sending all its strength and centuries of wisdom to the knight. The dragon's death sealed their bond and Dragon Knight was born. The ancient power slumbers in the Dragon Knight Davion, waking when he calls it. Or perhaps it is the Dragon that calls the Knight...

            <h2>Venomancer</h2>
            <p>
                In the Acid Jungles of Jidi Isle, poison runs in the veins and bubbles in the guts of every creature that scuttles, climbs or swoops between fluorescent vines dripping with caustic sap. Yet even in this toxic menagerie, Venomancer is acknowledged as the most venomous. Ages ago, an Herbalist named Lesale crossed the Bay of Fradj by coracle, searching for potent essences that might be extracted from bark and root, and found instead a nightmare transformation. Two leagues into Jidi's jungle, Lesale encountered a reptile camouflaged as an epiphyte, which stung him as he mistakenly plucked it. In desperation, he used his partial knowledge of the jungle's herbal bounty, mixing the venom of the (swiftly throttled) reptile with the nectar of an armored orchid, to compound an antidote. In the moments before a black paralysis claimed him completely, he injected himself by orchid-thorn, and instantly fell into a coma. Seventeen years later, something stirred in the spot where he had fallen, throwing off the years' accumulation of humus: Venomancer. Lesale the Herbalist no longer--but Lesale the Deathbringer. His mind was all but erased, and his flesh had been consumed and replaced by a new type of matter--one fusing the venom of the reptile with the poisonous integument of the orchid. Jidi's Acid Jungles knew a new master, one before whom even the most vicious predators soon learned to bow or burrow for their lives. The lurid isle proved too confining, and some human hunger deep in the heart of the Venomancer drove Lesale out in search of new poisons--and new deaths to bring.

            <h2>Beast Master</h2>
            <p>
                Karroch was born a child of the stocks. His mother died in childbirth; his father, a farrier for the Mad King of Slom, was trampled to death when he was five. Afterward Karroch was indentured to the king’s menagerie, where he grew up among all the beasts of the royal court: lions, apes, fell-deer, and things less known, things barely believed in. When the lad was seven, an explorer brought in a beast like none before seen. Dragged before the King in chains, the beast spoke, though its mouth moved not. Its words: a plea for freedom. The King only laughed and ordered the beast perform for his amusement; and when it refused, struck it with the Mad Scepter and ordered it dragged to the stocks. Over the coming months, the boy Karroch sneaked food and medicinal draughts to the wounded creature, but only managed to slow its deterioration. Wordlessly, the beast spoke to the boy, and over time their bond strengthened until the boy found he could hold up his end of a conversation--could in fact speak now to all the creatures of the King's menagerie. On the night the beast died, a rage came over the boy. He incited the animals of the court to rebel and threw open their cages to set them amok on the palace grounds. The Mad King was mauled in the mayhem. In the chaos, one regal stag bowed to the boy who had freed him; and with Beastmaster astride him, leapt the high walls of the estate, and escaped. Now a man, Karroch the Beastmaster has not lost his ability to converse with wild creatures. He has grown into a warrior at one with nature’s savagery.

                Fast when he needs to be, and a cunning strategist, Ish'Kafel the Dark Seer requires no edged weapons to vanquish his enemies, relying instead on the strength of his powerful mind. His talent lies in his ability to maneuver the fight to his advantage. Hailing from a place he calls 'The Land behind the wall,' Dark Seer remains an outsider here—a warrior from a realm beyond the veil of this reality. Once a great general among his people, and a valiant defender of the god-king Damathryx, Dark Seer’s army was wiped out by a much larger force in the final days of the Great Boundaries War. Facing certain defeat, he made one last desperate act: he led the enemy forces into the maze between the walls. At the last moment, just before capture, he crossed over—then sealed the walls forever in an explosive release of dark energy. When the dust settled, he saw that he had saved his people but found himself blinking at the sun of a different world, with no way to return. Now he is committed to proving his worth as a military strategist, and vows to show that he’s the greatest tactician this strange new world has ever seen.
